  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: September 7, 2025</p>

  <p>Voicelyn (“Voicelyn”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) provides booking and scheduling software for small businesses. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our services and websites.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> name, email address, business name, tenant type, and preferences you provide during signup.</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduling Data:</strong> services, staff names, availability, and appointment details you create in Voicelyn.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrations:</strong> if you connect third-party services (e.g., Google Calendar, Twilio), we process the data necessary to provide the integration. We do not store provider credentials in the frontend.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> device/browser type, IP address, and basic analytics necessary to operate and secure the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Google User Data</h2>
  <p>If you connect Google Calendar, we use Google API Services to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read calendar availability (busy times) to prevent double‑booking.</li>
    <li>Create, update, and cancel appointments that you book through Voicelyn.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We only request the minimum scopes needed (e.g., <code>calendar.readonly</code>, <code>calendar.events</code>). We do not sell Google user data. You can revoke access at any time in your Google Account permissions.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve scheduling, messaging, and calendar sync features.</li>
    <li>Send confirmations and reminders you elect to send to your customers.</li>
    <li>Prevent double‑booking by checking your calendar’s busy times.</li>
    <li>Maintain service security, reliability, and compliance (e.g., carrier STOP/HELP rules for SMS).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We share data with service providers (e.g., hosting, messaging) strictly to deliver our services under appropriate safeguards and only as necessary.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. Do not place secrets in client‑side code. Credentials for third‑party services are handled server‑side and protected in transit and at rest.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can disconnect integrations (e.g., Google Calendar) at any time.</li>
    <li>For SMS, end‑users may reply “STOP” to opt out (carrier rules apply).</li>
    <li>You can request account deletion and data export by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data for as long as needed to provide the service and as required by law. You may request deletion at any time; some records may be retained to meet legal obligations or resolve disputes.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed and stored in the United States or other countries where our providers operate.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Voicelyn is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us personal information, contact us to remove it.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised version with an updated effective date.</p>
